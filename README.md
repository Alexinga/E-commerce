Kiwi E-commerce

I created an E-commerce store using React.js, Redux, React Router, TailwindCss, Strapi CMS, Stripe Payment Gateway API.

In the app you are available:
-Place an Order
-Save products into you wishlist page.
-Click on items to see description
-Add to cart to checkout
-Filter for specific products on category page.
